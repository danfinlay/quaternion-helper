# Quaternion Helper
## A set of helper functions for manipulating rotations in three dimensions.

Ripped directly out of my first quaternion-using project, [Voxel Zigfu](https://github.com/flyswatter/voxel-zigfu).

Sorry for being light on documentation, I just wanted to share some of that code with another project that involved pointing 3D objects at other objects.
